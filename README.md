# IF-ROS

**IF-ROS** is a ROS package that implements Insetting Formation(IF)-Based trajectory planning and cooperative control for the transportation system of cable-suspended payload with multi UAVs, which includes:

- `inset_ros_msgs`: messages corresponding to polyhedron and ellipsoid
- `inset_test_node`: test IF algorithm
- `InsetUtil`: C++ package that implements IF algorithm
- `iris-distro`: IRIS algorithm for iterative convex regional inflation by semidefinite programming
- `multi_main_controller`:  cooperative controller for the transportation system of cable-suspended payload with multi UAVs
- `waypoint_generator`: process waypoints

## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Prerequisite:

- `ROS(melodic)`
- [`catkin_simple`](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple)
- [`coppeliasim(V4.3.0 for Ubuntu 18.04) `](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/previousVersions)

Please refer to the [ROS tutorial](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/ros1Tutorial.htm) to enable CoppeliaSim ROS.

If the submodule is not initialized yet, run following commands at first:

```bash
cd /PATH/TO/IF_ROS
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 1.2 Install IRIS

In order to successfully compile the iris-distro package in this package, please follow the requirements provided in https://github.com/rdeits/iris-distro .

And make sure that the required Python modules are enabled, e.g. by inserting into your `.bashrc` file: `export PYTHONPATH=:${PYTHONPATH}:<python_prefix>` .

### 1.3 Install Mosek

You'll also need a license for the [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) optimization toolbox(iris-distro package includes a downloader for the Mosek code, but you have to get your own license). Mosek has free licenses available for academic use.

After obtaining a Mosek license, you need to enable it, e.g. by inserting into your `.bashrc` file: `export PATH=$PATH:/PATH/TO/mosek/mosek.lic`

### 1.4 Install CasADi

See [InstallationLinux](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationLinux) for the CasADi installation processã€‚

If there are issues with locating CasADi library .so files, run `sudo ldconfig` in the terminal of the build folder where CasADi is installed.

## 2. Compilation

Using Catkin Tools (Recommended):

First, ensure that both [`catkin_simple`](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple) and `IF_ROS` are located in the `/PATH/TO/catkin_ws/src` directory. Then, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
cd /PATH/TO/catkin_ws
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
catkin build
```

Alternatively, if you want to debug, enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
cd /PATH/TO/catkin_ws
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
catkin build
```

## 3. Usage

First, enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
roscore
```

Then, start CoppeliaSim, open the corresponding scene file `cross.ttt`, and initiate the simulation.

Finally, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd /PATH/TO/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash 
roslaunch inset_test_node cross.launch 
```

The experiment scene file path : `/PATH/TO/IF_ROS/multi_main_controller/Experimental_scene/cross.ttt`
